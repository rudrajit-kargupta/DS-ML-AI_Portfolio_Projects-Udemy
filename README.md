# DS-ML-AI_Portfolio_Projects-Udemy
Portfolio Projects on Data Science from the course "Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp"

Built on Python using Jupyter Notebook using Anaconda 4.8.3. Because I used conda to setup the environment, most of the following libraries came pre-installed in the environement. However, if using some other platform ensure that the followng libraries are installed in your environment: NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn , Matplotlib , Plotly , Scikit-Learn , Tensorflow. 

Contains some basic projects on:
1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
4. Random Forests
5. Support Vector Machines
6. K-Means Clustering
